## Security Features

- **JWT Token Authentication**: Automatic JWT token handling for all API calls
- **Token Management**: Secure token storage in localStorage with automatic header injection
- **Endpoint Security**: 
  - **Login/Register**: Uses public HTTP client (no authentication required)
  - **All other endpoints**: Automatically includes JWT token in Authorization header
- **Secure Password Handling**: Client-side password validation
- **Automatic Logout**: Token removal and state cleanup on logout
- **Protected Routes**: Authentication-based navigation and UI elements
- **Input Validation**: Client-side form validation and sanitization

## JWT Token Implementation

The application implements a robust JWT authentication system:

1. **Login/Register**: Uses `PublicApiClient` for unauthenticated endpoints
2. **All Customer Operations**: Uses `ApiClient` with `AuthenticatedHttpClientHandler`
3. **Automatic Token Injection**: The `AuthenticatedHttpClientHandler` automatically adds the JWT token from localStorage to every API request
4. **Token Persistence**: JWT tokens are stored in localStorage and persist across browser sessions
5. **Clean Logout**: Removes tokens and clears authentication state on logout

### HTTP Client Configuration:
- `PublicApiClient`: For `/api/auth/login` and `/api/auth/register` (no auth required)
- `ApiClient`: For all other endpoints (includes JWT token automatically)

The application provides a complete, modern customer management solution with a focus on user experience, security, and responsive design.
